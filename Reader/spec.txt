[format] # could be omaha, 5cs, holdem, etc. (TODO: INCLUDE REMAINING FORMATS)
[limit type] # pl for pot limit, nl for no limit
[blinds] # two comma separated values with no white space (e.g. 50,100)
[player_name] seat_number starting_stack
... # Space separated list of all starting players formatted as above. 0 is dealer, 1 is SB, etc.

# Throughout a game there are numerous events that can happen. Here's what we expect and will attempt to handle:
#     * player bets (can be any street)
#     * hand is dealt
#     * board is updated
#     * player join at a given position with a starting stack
#     * player leaves
#     * game type changes (important for dealer's choice style events)

# We want to minimize duplicate information for the sake of file size, simplicity, and statelessness.
# As long as we have all the above information we should be able to fully reconstruct a hand by induction.
# It will be the responsibility of the file reader to keep track of this state, though.

# The remaining portion of the file will be a canonical, line-separated series of structures representing each event.
# Now, let's go through each event and introduce the structure that represents it. First up is a bet:

# Format: bet [player_name] [bet_amount OR f] # an f denotes a fold
# Examples:

bet "Mark" 100
bet "Grant" f



# Next up dealing a new hand

# Format: hand [list player_name]
# Example:



# Board update:

# Format: deal [space separated list of card names]
# Examples:

deal As 5h Tc # This could be a holdem flop
deal Kd # This could be the turn



# Player join:

# Format: join [player_name] [whom they are to the right of] [starting_stack]
# Examples:

join "Daniel" 0 2000 # A player named Daniel joins to the right of the original dealer (or whomever is now sitting to the right of the dealer)
join "Doyle" 3 1630 # A player named Doyle joins to the right of the original UTG



# Player leave:

# Format: leave [player_name]
# Example:

leave "Daniel" # A reader can determine the new seating order without specifying the seat of the departing player



# Game type change

# Format: new [format] [limit type] [blinds]
# Examples:

new omaha pl 25,50 # Here, we have changed the mode to pot limit omaha with 25 chip sb, 50 chip bb


# Assumptions:
#     * Betting and the blinds rotate clockwise
#     * When a player join, they will be participating in the next hand. If they are just sitting at the table,
#       we don't want to invoke the join event until they are playing the following hand.
